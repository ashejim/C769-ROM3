### Excellence Archive

The [Capstone Excellence Archive](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/capstonearchives/excellence/Pages/UndergraduateInformation.aspx) includes a wide range of completed conclusion reports (task 3). When reviewing archived capstones, keep in mind that they all are, by definition, *above and beyond* the requirements. Therefore, do not use these as examples of what's needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what's required, see the above [Examples](resources:examples) section. Note that the archive has all recognized C769 capstones are categorized as *BS Information Technology* regardless of degree emphasis.

### Grammar

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769-ROM3/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version compatible with MS Word.

Get the best writing help from the writing experts: [WGU Writing Center](https://my.wgu.edu/success-centers/writing-center). While Writing Center Instructors cannot say whether a task will pass, they can help you revise your paper to meet WGU competency standards for professional communication, sources, and APA formatting. The Writing Center also offers live Q & A sessions covering a variety of topics which include general writing and grammar help.

## Sources and Professional Communication

It's easy to overlook them when focusing on content, but grammar, sources, and APA formatting are the most common reasons for rejected submissions! Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Coaching-Center/I-Need-Help-with-Professional-Communication/ta-p/23355) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769-ROM3/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Get your [FREE Gramamrly education license](https://www.grammarly.com/edu/western-governors-university) through WGU.  

Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) can prevent competency in *Professional Communication*.

```{warning}
Grammar is now assessed using AI. Do not copy and paste from the Grammarly app into MS Word. It is best to make revisions directly in MS Word.
```

For more details, see:

-[Help with Professionl Commnication](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Coaching-Center/I-Need-Help-with-Professional-Communication/ta-p/23355)

Sources and format should consistenely follow a recognized academic writing style. We recommend [APA $7^{\text{th}}$ edition guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org). Outside of grammar mistakes, most style errors involve formatting of the sources or in-text citations. For APA, in-text citations should be of the form `(Author, year)`. For more details, see [APA guidelines for citations](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations).

### Webinars and Cohorts

#### 5 days to Finish C769 Task 2 Challenge Cohort  

Keep an eye out for the *5 Days to Finish Task 2 Challenge* Cohort. You will usually see the enrollment on Mondays in the course of study in the section Labeled *Explore Cohort*. The *Explore Cohort* section will **not be seen once enrollment is closed**. It will start on Wednesdays and will kick off with a live webinar at 7 PM ET. Each day of the cohort I will email support for a section or 2 of the proposal (task 2) to help you finish within 5-10 days. Most tend to finish in 10 days.

Email Candice Allen [ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu](mailto:ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu?cc=candice.allen@wgu.edu&subject=C769%20capstone%20cohort&body=Your%20name%20and%20question%20here.%20We%20can%20only%20respond%20to%20messages%20from%20a%20valid%20WGU%20email%20address.%20%0A%0ADegree%20program%3A%20%0AProgram%20Mentor%3A%20%0A) for more information or questions.

(resources:general:welcomeemail)=

### Welcome Email

We've tried to provide everything you need here on this website as a more complete and readily available resource than the "welcome email," i.e., the *non-automated* introductory email from your assigned course instructor containing the tips and resources needed to get started in the right direction. However, we often get asked for the email, and I suppose this website would be incomplete without it. So here is an example of a "welcome email."

```{admonition} A Welcome Email
Welcome to C769! I'm your capstone advisor. See the [C769 IT Capstone website](https://ashejim.github.io/C769-ROM3/intro_ROM3.html) for almost everything you need. 

Your first step is choosing a topic. Any IT project is allowable, provided it has the following:

1. A client with an IT problem (you can fabricate a client whose problem needs your chosen solution.)
2. Implementing a hard IT deliverable (software or hardware) that helps solve that problem.

This is a written exercise. An actual project is not required, but fabricated projects should be written as realistically as possible. While it may need some revising, you can reuse any previous professional or academic work. The capstone project is similar to the Emerging Technologies project. However, in this project, you choose the client and problem. So select the problem you want to write about.

Complete the [approval form](https://ashejim.github.io/C769-ROM3/task1_ROM3.html#topic-approval) and email it to your assignged course instructor for review and signature. Afterward, you can start working on Task 2. Questions? It’s why we’re here. Contact us by email (fastest) or live appointment (best for general discussions). Here you can find all [C769 CI's contact information](https://ashejim.github.io/C769-ROM3/ci_page.html#course-faculty).

### Accelerated Plan

Nearing the end of your term? Plan accordingly *Note: This video was created for ROM2 but is mostly relevant for ROM3..*:

<!-- <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e5deb87f-d7ee-42c8-9c02-b10a013f0dae" title="Passing C769 before your end of term" frameborder="0" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" alt= "Title screen for video">

```{warning}
Be aware that task 2 and 3 evaluations often take the full three days. Therefore, if you are approaching the end of your term, don't wait on task 2 to start task 3 and submit task 3 early enough to have it returned, revised, and resubmitted.
```
