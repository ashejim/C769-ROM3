Students starting C769 after 8/25/2024 will be automatically enrolled in the newest version, ROM3. The ROM3 requirements are very similar to ROM2. However, faculty could only review the new course after its release, and there may be some minor discrepancies between the latest course and our stated best practices.

*Most* of Task 3 will build on Task 2, updating it from the future to the past tense. So typically, Task 3 will be similar in length and detail to Task 2. Review the [task 3 examples](resources:examples) to understand what evaluators expect. Differences between tasks 2 and 3 are included in the [task 3 template](task3:template) and covered in the sections below, but here is an overview:

<div class = "tasklist">

   <input type="checkbox"> **A:** From Task 2, combine A1, A2, and A3 and update to the *past* tense.
   
   <input type="checkbox"> **B and B.1:** It is the same as Task 2, section B, except you need three works not referenced in Task 2.
   
   <input type="checkbox"> **C:** Update Task 2 section D to discuss how your project advanced the client's strategy OR culture.

   <input type="checkbox"> **D:** Update Task 2 section E, to the past tense.
   
   <input type="checkbox"> **E:** Choose *one* goal from Task 2 section F,  then summarize the goal and how its objectives were met or not met.

   <input type="checkbox"> **F:** Update the timeline from Task 2 and explain any changes.

   <input type="checkbox"> **G:** *New section*. Explain any differences between Task 2 and Task 3.

   <input type="checkbox"> **H  and H1:** Discuss the results, the present and future impact, and use the metric(s) from Task 2 *Outcomes* to explain the project's success.

   <input type="checkbox"> **I** *New Section*. Explain and include three *examples* of artifacts.  

</div>

```{warning}
Submissions with missing sections are automatically returned. If everything went as planned, explain why. The narrative following the *Timeline* and an *Unanticipated Requirements* section is still required.
```

(task3:A)=

## A: Overview

You can combine and revise Task 2 sections [A1, A2, and A3](task2:A), adjusting for any variances and providing a summary of the completed project. In addition, you can reuse any content from related task 3 sections [C](task3:C) and [D](task3:D). As this section often combines and revises Task 2 Sections A1, A2, and A3; it is typically of similar length.

```{tip}
- The required depth of detail is up to the subjectivity of the evaluator. Though summaries are typically short, there is no penalty for *too much* detail. 
```

(task3:B)=

## B and B1: Review of Other Works & Works Supporting Implementation

The requirements for this section are identical to that of [task 2 section B](task2:B) -only you must have **three** works different from those in task 2 cited following [APA guidelines](task3:grammar), e.g., (Author year).

1. **Summarize the work.** tell your reader what the work is about; there is no need to offer an opinion or analyze it -simply summarize the content. We recommend 1-2 paragraphs per work.
2. **Include an in-text citation,** e.g., (Author, year) for [APA guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date). Consider using a [referencing tool](resources:general:grammar:sources).
3. **Relate the work to your project.** Following the summary, describe how the work expands the context of the problem or supports the implementation solution. We recommend at least one paragraph per work.

<!-- - [WGU's library](https://wgu.libguides.com/friendly.php?s=library)
- [google.scholar.com](https://scholar.google.com/) -->

Cite the task 2 sources if needed elsewhere, but it is recommended to not include the task 2 sources in this section.

(task3:C)=

## C: Changes to Project Environment

Task 2 section D, *Current Environment*, discussed how your project will improve the client's strategy and align with it's culuture. Update this section to discuss how your project positively impacted the client's strategy OR promotes its culture (you are requried to discuss one but not both). Providing examples will help paint the picture for the reader. For example:

> Previously, customer support staff had one Excel spreadsheet to track customer issues. Frequently, data was lost or accidentally overwritten. It was difficult to easily find support tickets.  After implementing ZenDesk, support tickets are entered into the system and saved in a database. Users can enter tickets and easily track them through the system.

(task3:D)=

## D: Methodology

Adding any variations, revise [Task 2 section E, *Methodology*](task2:E), from the future to the past tense.

(task3:E)=

## E: Project Goals and Objectives

Summarize how the implementation steps from sections A and D accomplished (or failed to accomplish) *one* goal and each of the goal’s objectives from [Task 2 section F](task2:F).

(task3:F)=

## F: Project Timeline

<!-- TODO add? Also, do I need planned and actual dates on the milestones?
For the timeline? Yes. They need a timeline for all items on the table, and they need to compare those dates to what was proposed. However, it doesn’t have actually to match task 2. The point is so they won’t have to open task 2 when assessing the timeline narrative and ‘unanticipated requirements’ of task 3.
 -->

1. Update the timeline table from [task 2 section G](task2:G) with columns for *Planned Duration*, *Actual Duration*, *Actual Start Date*, and *Actual End Date*.

   |Milestone or Deliverable  |Planned Duration  | Actual Duration  | Actual Start Date| Actual End date
   --- | --- | ---| ---| ---|
   |Some milestones |7 days|7 days|7/23/2022|7/30/2022|
   |Some deliverables |14 days|10 days|7/18/2022|7/28/2022|
   |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

   ```{note}
   *All dates must be in the past.* Task 3 is a conclusion report. Write as if you recently completed the project -even if the dates do not align with the task 2 projected end dates. Evaluators understand this is a written exercise, and academic timelines rarely sync with real-world timelines. See the [FAQ](task3:faq:timeline) for more details. 
   ```

2. Following the updated timeline, add a narrative (1-2 pargraphs) explaining any differences from the projected proposal timeline, [task 2 section G](task2:G). If there were no variances, explain why.

   ```{warning}
   Do *not* leave this section blank. It is easy to overlook, but submissions with no timeline narrative will not be accepted. 
   ```

(task3:G)=

## G: Unanticipated Scope Creep

Describe any unanticipated requirements and how you dealt with them. Include any varainces discussed in the previous section [Task 3 section F](task3:F) or other sections. If everything went as planned, explain why. *Do not leave this section blank.*

(task3:H)=

## H and H1: Conclusion & Success of Project

Summarize the results and potential effects of your completed project compared to the expected outcomes outlined in [task 2 section H](task2:H).

- Summarize results and effects of the completed project.
- Discuss immediate and potential future impacts of the completed project.
- (H1) Using the metric(s) provided in Task 2 section H, *Outcomes*, explain why the project was or was not successful.

(task3:I)=

## I: Appendices

In the appendices you must include at least **three** things you created that demonstrate the project's completion. The included items need only be *examples* of actual artifacts or deliverable. They can be fabricated entirely, examples, or parts of actual artifacts. For each appendix (there are three),

1. Provide a description of the artifact (1-2 paragraphs).
2. Provide an example of the described artifact. 

Accepted items include the following:

- Code or script samples
- Screenshots of deliverable
- Process diagrams such as flowcharts or UMLs
- Visualizations such as charts, tables, or graphs
- Network diagrams
- Training certificates/questions
- The technical IT product

```{tip}
If reusing materials from an open source or actual project, mask any identifying information.

(task2:grammar)=

## J and K: Sources and Professional Communication

It's easy to overlook them when focusing on content, but grammar, sources, and APA formatting are the most common reasons for rejected submissions! Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Coaching-Center/I-Need-Help-with-Professional-Communication/ta-p/23355) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769-ROM3/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Get your [FREE Gramamrly education license](https://www.grammarly.com/edu/western-governors-university) through WGU.  

Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) can prevent competency in *Professional Communication*.

```{warning}
Grammar is now assessed using AI. Do not copy and paste from the Grammarly app into MS Word. It is best to make revisions directly in MS Word.
```

For more details, see:

-[Help with Professionl Commnication](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Coaching-Center/I-Need-Help-with-Professional-Communication/ta-p/23355)

Sources and format should consistenely follow a recognized academic writing style. We recommend [APA $7^{\text{th}}$ edition guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org). Outside of grammar mistakes, most style errors involve formatting of the sources or in-text citations. For APA, in-text citations should be of the form `(Author, year)`. For more details, see [APA guidelines for citations](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations).

(task3:faq)=

## FAQ

### What are the most common reasons task 3 does not pass?

The most common reasons for returned task 3's:

1. Grammar
2. Sources
3. No narrative for [part F, Project Timeline](task3:F).
4. Insufficient details for section "X."

1-3 is easily avoidable. Being cited for "insufficient details" is a matter of subjectivity, but it is also easy to fix -just add more details. Since task 3 mostly implements the already passed plan of task 2 -it is mostly already passed.

### How long should task 3 be?

Review the [task 3 examples](resources:examples). As task 3 mainly rewrites task, task 3 is typically similar in length. They will assess task 3 independently of task 2. Don't assume they'll compare the two.  

### My capstone is not a real project. What do I do for the deliverables?

See [section I](task3:I). You only need to provide *examples* of actual deliverables you might provide to clients demonstrating a project's completion.

(task3:faq:timeline)=

### My task 2 timeline has projected end dates of 6 months (since this is what it would take), but I just submitted task 2 and need to complete task 3 now. What should I do?

Evaluators understand this is a written exercise, and academic timelines rarely sync with real-world timelines. *Write as if you recently completed the project* -dates do not need to align with those in task 2, but the task 3 start and end dates *must be in the past.* For example, if task 2 had the following:

   |Milestone or Deliverable  |Duration  | Projected Start Date| Projected End date
   --- | --- | ---| ---|
   |Some milestones |7 days|<span style="color:red">**7/23/2023**</span>|<span style="color:red">**7/30/2023**</span>|
   |Some deliverables |14 days|<span style="color:red">**7/16/2023**</span>|<span style="color:red">**7/30/2023**</span>|
   |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

But task 3 was submitted on 4/28/2023, it might be adjusted by moving back dates such that the timeframes are preserved as follows:

   |Milestone or Deliverable  |Planned Duration  | Actual Duration  | Actual Start Date| Actual End date
   --- | --- | ---| ---| ---|
   |Some milestones |7 days|7 days|<span style="color:green">**4/21/2023**</span>|<span style="color:green">**4/28/2023**</span>|
   |Some deliverables |14 days|14 days|<span style="color:green">**4/14/2023**</span>|<span style="color:green">**4/28/2023**</span>|
   |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

The narrative following the timeline can then explain that the project started earlier than expected (even if these dates preceded task 2's submission).

### I've completed task 3, but task 2 is still in the assessment queue. Should I wait until task 2 passes submitting task 3?

If you're nearing the end of your term, you should submit task 3 as soon as it's ready. If task 2 gets returned, task 3 will also automatically be returned. However, if it passes, task 3 will keep its place in the assessment queue.

### My task was returned for "In-text citations could not be found..."

**My task two was returned for *sources* stating:**
> "In-text citations could not be found for portions of the task that have been quoted or paraphrased... "
**What does this comment mean?**

This comment indicates they could not find a matching in-text citation for every source on your reference list. Check that each reference has a match following APA style, e.g., (Author, year), and remove any references without matches. Use a [referencing tool](resources:general:grammar:sources) to create, manage references, and avoid such errors. Follow the in-text citations and the reference page format of the [tasks 2 and 3 examples](resources:examples).
