# Welcome to C769!

Welcome! The IT capstone is a written project demonstrating competency in your field through communicating the planning and implementation of an IT solution to a business problem.

The capstone includes three parts:

1. **Task One:** Get course instructor topic approval -a preliminary step to ensure you start in the right direction.
2. **Task two:** The Proposal -a detailed paper describing a client's problem and how you will implement an IT solution to solve it. Most of your work will be here.
3. **Task three:** The Conclusion Report -a detailed paper describing the concluded project proposed in task two. Most of task three repeats task two.

First, understand the project's requirements. What they are -and what they aren't. Watch the following video:

To meet the requirements of Tasks 2 and 3, your topic (Task 1) must have the following:

1. A *specific* client with an IT need or problem (you can fabricate a client who needs your preferred solution.)
2. The implementation of a [hard IT deliverable](task1:faq:hard) that addresses the client's need or problem.

Your topic *should not* describe a framework for a general approach, nor only provide an assessment of issues or advice on improvements. Specific hard IT deliverables (hardware or software changes) must be included in Task 2 (the proposal) and Task 3 (the conclusion report). For many projects, such as security projects, plans for specific hardware/software updates often follow an investigation. In these cases, assume when writing Tasks 2 and 3 that the investigation has been done and the issues to be fixed are known.
